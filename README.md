# Simple-ISA-Simulator

* Desktop JavaFX application representing simplified Instruction set architecture simulator with 4 general purpose registers and 64-bit address space.

* The instruction set includes:
  * basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction)
  * basic bit logical operations (AND, OR, NOT)
  * instructions for working with memory (MOV)

* The instructions are executed on the appropriate interpreter. Support for keyboard input and screen printing (READ, WRITE) is provided.

* Simple debugging support is provided. Debugging mode allows single-step execution and viewing the values of all registers and requested memory addresses at set breakpoints during execution.

* Instructions required for conditional branching (eg CMP, JE, JNE, JA, JB, JZ) have been implemented
